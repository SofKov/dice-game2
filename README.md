Two-player variation of the dice game

Theme changed to RuPaul's Drag Race - Lipsync for your LIFE

The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
In each turn, a player rolls the dice as many times as they wish. Each result gets added to their overall score
The player can choose to 'HOLD', adding their current score to their overall score, finishing their turn
BUT, if the player rolls a 1, their overall score goes back to 0, and it's the next player's turn
The first player to reach an overall score of 20 or above, wins the game!
